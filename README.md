# Codeforces Solutions Repository

This repository contains solutions to Codeforces problems. For each problem, you will find:

- Java and C++ implementations of the solution.
- Intuition and approach explanation.
- Time complexity and space complexity analysis.

---

## Repository Structure

Each problem folder contains:

- `main.java` - Java solution code.
- `main.cpp` - C++ solution code.
- `README.md` - Problem statement summary including intuition and complexity.

---

## Purpose

This repository is designed as a learning resource and reference for solving Codeforces problems with well-documented implementations and detailed explanations for better understanding. <br><br>Please ignore if any mistakes. I am also learning along with you.

---

## Contributions

Contributions in the form of new problem solutions or improvements to existing ones are welcome. Please follow the existing file and documentation style.

---

## How to Use

Browse problems by their Codeforces problem number or name. Review the problem explanation and code in your preferred language. Use the intuition and complexity sections to understand the reasoning behind the solutions.
