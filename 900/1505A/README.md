## Topics  
- Implementation  
- Strings  
- Input/Output  
- Interactive

## Constraints  
- Input: arbitrary strings (no specific constraints on length or characters)  
- Output: always "NO" for each input line  
- Time limit per test: 1 second  
- Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes  

## Intuition / Approach  
- The problem is essentially a **joke problem** in Codeforces.  
- For every line of input, regardless of its content, the program must output `"NO"`.  
- There is no computation, no conditions, and no logic beyond reading input until the end of file (EOF).  
- In C++ this is done with `while(cin >> s)`, and in Java with `while(sc.hasNext())`.  

## Time and Space Complexity  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where n is the number of input tokens (each read once).  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, only constant space used for storing the current string.
