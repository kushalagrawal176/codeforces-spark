**Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2086/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2086/A)  

---

## Topics
- Implementation  
- Math  

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4  
- 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^8  
- Time limit per test: 2 second  
- Memory limit per test: 512 megabytes  

## Intuition / Approach
- The problem is straightforward: for each test case, given an integer `n`, we need to output `2 × n`.  
- There are no tricky conditions or edge cases since the operation is purely arithmetic.  
- Approach:  
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.  
  - For each test case, read the integer `n`.  
  - Compute `2 × n` and print the result.  

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(1)` per test case, since only a single multiplication is performed.  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, no extra space apart from variables.
